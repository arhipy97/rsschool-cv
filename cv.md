## *Summary*

I’m an advanced PC user. I’ve been interested in computers, information technologies and everything related to it since childhood. Despite the fact that I got another education, as this subject is interesting to me, I began to learn it on my own.

I learned the basic principles of Javascript and its environment, I tried to make simple web applications. The work done showed that my applications have poor visual design, and the algorithms used need optimization. Therefore, I need a mentor to point out my mistakes and suboptimal solutions in frontend development.

I want to learn how to develop using React Redux or Angular, but also ready to learn other technologies.

I learn quickly, I am patient and stress resistant, always open to the perception of something new, ready to work hard to achieve my goals.I am polite, tactful and disciplined.
